    "From the plot above, we can see that the mean is the center of gravity or balance point of the distribution. If you cut the distribution out of cardboard, and then placed your finger at the mean, the distribution would perfectly balance on your finger. Since the distribution above is right skewed (which means it has a long right tail), we know that the mean of the distribution is larger than the median, which is the “halfway” point of the data. Conversely, if the distribution had been left skewed, we know the mean would be smaller than the median.\n",

    "We are also interested in the standard deviation of mother’s ages. The SD gives us a sense of how variable mothers' ages are around the average mothers' age. If the SD is large, then the mothers' ages should spread over a large range from the mean. If the SD is small, then the mothers' ages should be tightly clustered around the average mother age. \n",

    "## Variability of the Sample Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "By the [Central Limit Theorem](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/4/Central_Limit_Theorem.html), the probability distribution of the mean or sum of a large random sample is roughly normal. The bell curve is centered at the population mean. Some of the sample means are higher and some are lower, but the deviations from the population mean are roughly symmetric on either side, as we have seen repeatedly. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our simulations, we also noticed that the means of larger samples tend to be more tightly clustered around the population mean than means of smaller samples. In this section, we will quantify the [variability of the sample mean](https://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/14/5/Variability_of_the_Sample_Mean.html) and develop a relation between the variability and the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the salaries of employees of the City of San Francisco in 2014. The mean salary reported by the city government was about $75,463.92.\n",
    "\n",
